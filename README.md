#Github Repositories listing

##Find a User
Use this app to find any github user and all their repositories.

##Description
Use /profile/input to input a Github username. This app will then call Github's
API and return a list of the users repositories and profile information.
This application's design is a close recreation of Github's repository tab for
learning purposes.
